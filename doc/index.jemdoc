== About me
I am a postdoc fellow at the Vector Institute. Previously, I did my postdoc at McGill University/Mila, under the supervision of Prof. [http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~arbel/ Tal Arbel].
I obtained Ph.D. degree from Université Laval, under the supervision of Prof. [https://chgagne.github.io/english/ Christian Gagné] and Prof. [https://sites.google.com/site/borriewang/ Boyu Wang].

{{<b>}} Research Interests {{</b>}}  I am working on a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety reliable] and [https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/ responsible] use of Machine Learning, 
with a particular focus on mitigating [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) bias and discrinminations] in machine learning. 
I believe that tackling these issues is pivotal for ensuring the responsible use of machine learning. My recent papers, such as those presented at ICML 2024, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10837 NeurIPS 2022], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13316 ICML 2022], and [https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01738 MICCAI 2023], delve into the details of my research in this area. 
Previously, I worked on reliable machine learning through distribution shift by developing theories and algorithms.
