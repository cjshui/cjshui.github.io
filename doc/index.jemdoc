== About me
I am a postdoc fellow at the Vector Institute. Previously, I did my postdoc at McGill University/Mila, under the supervision of Prof. [http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~arbel/ Tal Arbel].
I obtained Ph.D. degree from Université Laval, under the supervision of Prof. [https://chgagne.github.io/english/ Christian Gagné] and Prof. [https://sites.google.com/site/borriewang/ Boyu Wang].

{{<b>}} Research Interests {{</b>}} I work on machine learning under distribution shift by developping theories and algorithms for reliable  ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10837 algorithmic fairness],
