== About me
I recently started my postdoc fellow at the Vector Institute. Previously, I did my postdoc at McGill University/Mila, under the supervision of Prof. [http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~arbel/ Tal Arbel].
I obtained Ph.D. degree from Université Laval, under the supervision of Prof. [https://chgagne.github.io/english/ Christian Gagné] and Prof. [https://sites.google.com/site/borriewang/ Boyu Wang].

{{<b>}} Research Interests {{</b>}} I work on theories and algorithms for reliable  (algorithmic fairness, robustness,
out-of-distribution generalization) and data-efficient (transfer learning, meta-learning, multitask learning, active learning) machine learning  and their applications in data mining and health-care.
